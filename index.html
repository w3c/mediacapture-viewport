        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document describes an extension to the Screen Capture API [[screen-capture]]
        that enables the acquisition of the browser viewport (the current tab), in the form
        of a video track. In some cases, tab audio is also captured in the form of an audio
        track. This enables use cases such as: recording an ongoing WebRTC [[WEBRTC]] video
        meeting, or a user in a video meeting sharing their presentation without having to
        locate it in a picker, by instead clicking a button in their presentation application.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature is only available to "cross-origin isolated" documents. This prevents
        applications from using this API to access potentially confidential information from
        other origins, content that should remain inaccessible due to the protections offered
        by the user agent sandbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature has security implications, and requires a permission prompt. Sharing
        the rendered viewport may expose user information such as browsing history
        (through link purpling), personal details like address or payment info (through
        user agent or web extension features like form autofill), or personal preferences
        (like font size).

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the [=user agent =] that implements the interfaces that it
        contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs defined in this
        specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings
        defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that
        specification and terminology.

        Example

      <p>
        The following example demonstrates a request for viewport capture using the
        <code>navigator.mediaDevices.getViewportMedia</code> method defined in this
        document.

      <pre class="example highlight">try {

        Terminology
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the definitions of {{MediaStream}}, {{MediaStreamTrack}},
        {{MediaStreamConstraints}} and {{ConstrainablePattern}}
        from [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], and the definitions of
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-display-surface">display surface</a>
        and <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-browser">browser display surface</a>
        from [[!screen-capture]].

      <h2>
        Capturing Viewport Media
      </h2>
      <p>
        Capture of the Viewport is enabled through the addition of a new
        {{MediaDevices/getViewportMedia}} method on the {{MediaDevices}}
        interface, that is similar to {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}},
        except it only captures the top-level document's viewport (current tab),
        using a permission prompt instead of presenting the user with a picker.
        For security reasons, it also only works from "cross-origin isolated"
        documents that opt-in with a document-policy.
      </p>
      <section>

          <dfn>MediaDevices</dfn> Additions
        </h2>
        <pre class="idl"
>partial interface MediaDevices {
  Promise&lt;MediaStream&gt; getViewportMedia(
      optional DisplayMediaStreamConstraints constraints = {});
};</pre>
        <dl data-link-for="MediaDevices" data-dfn-for="MediaDevices" class="methods">
          <dt>

          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Prompts the user for permission to live-capture the viewport (current tab).</p>
            <p>
              The user agent MUST apply any provided <var>constraints</var> to the produced
              media after permission has been granted.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of audio, the user agent MAY present the end-user with an option to
              include audio from the current viewport in the capture, if available. Like
              {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} with regards to audio+video, the user agent is
              allowed to not return audio even if the audio constraint is present. If the user
              agent knows no audio will be shared for the lifetime of the stream it MUST NOT
              include an audio track in the resulting stream. The user agent MAY accept a
              request for audio and video by only returning a video track in the resulting
              stream, or it MAY accept the request by returning both an audio track and a video
              track in the resulting stream. The user agent MUST reject audio-only requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}, the {{PermissionState/"granted"}}
              permission cannot be persisted.
            </p>
            <p>When the {{MediaDevices/getViewportMedia()}}
            method is called, the user agent MUST run the following
            steps:</p>
            <ol>
