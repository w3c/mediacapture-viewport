        This document defines how a browser viewport can be used as the source of a media stream using
        <code>getViewportMedia</code>, an extension to the Screen Capture API [[screen-capture]].

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes an extension to the Screen Capture API [[screen-capture]] that enables the acquisition
        of the browser viewport (the current tab), in the form of a video track. In some cases, tab audio is also
        captured in the form of an audio track. This enables use cases such as: recording an ongoing WebRTC [[WEBRTC]]
        video meeting, or a user in a video meeting sharing their presentation without having to locate it in a picker,
        by instead clicking a button in their presentation application.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature is only available to "cross-origin isolated" documents. This prevents applications from using this
        API to access potentially confidential information from other origins, content that should remain inaccessible
        due to the protections offered by the user agent sandbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feature has security implications, and requires a permission prompt. Sharing the rendered viewport may
        expose user information such as browsing history (through link purpling), personal details like address or
        payment info (through user agent or web extension features like form autofill), or personal preferences (like
        font size).

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the [=user agent =] that
        implements the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs defined in this specification must
        implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification
        [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>
        The following example demonstrates a request for viewport capture using the
        <code>navigator.mediaDevices.getViewportMedia</code> method defined in this document.
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
try {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getViewportMedia();
  videoElement.srcObject = stream;
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Unable to acquire viewport capture: ' + e);
}</pre
      >

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the definitions of {{MediaStream}}, {{MediaStreamTrack}}, {{MediaStreamConstraints}} and
        {{ConstrainablePattern}} from [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], and the definitions of
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-display-surface">display surface</a>
        and <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-browser">browser display surface</a>
        from [[!screen-capture]].

      <h2>Capturing Viewport Media</h2>
      <p>
        Capture of the viewport is enabled through the addition of a new {{MediaDevices/getViewportMedia}} method on the
        {{MediaDevices}} interface, that is similar to {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}, except it only captures the
        top-level document's viewport (current tab), using a permission prompt instead of presenting the user with a
        picker. For security reasons, it also only works from "cross-origin isolated" documents that opt-in with a
        document-policy.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2><dfn>MediaDevices</dfn> Additions</h2>
        <pre class="idl">
partial interface MediaDevices {
  Promise&lt;MediaStream&gt; getViewportMedia(
      optional ViewportMediaStreamOptions options = {});
};</pre
        >
        <dl data-link-for="MediaDevices" data-dfn-for="MediaDevices" class="methods">
          <dt>
            <dfn>getViewportMedia</dfn>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Prompts the user for permission to live-capture the viewport (current tab).</p>
            <p>
              The user agent MUST apply any provided <var>options</var> to the produced media after permission has been
              granted.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of audio, the user agent MAY present the end-user with an option to include audio from the
              current viewport in the capture, if available. Like {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} with regards to
              audio+video, the user agent is allowed to not return audio even if the audio constraint is present. If the
              user agent knows no audio will be shared for the lifetime of the stream it MUST NOT include an audio track
              in the resulting stream. The user agent MAY accept a request for audio and video by only returning a video
              track in the resulting stream, or it MAY accept the request by returning both an audio track and a video
              track in the resulting stream. The user agent MUST reject audio-only requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}}, the {{PermissionState/"granted"}} permission cannot be persisted.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the {{MediaDevices/getViewportMedia()}} method is called, the user agent MUST run the following
              steps:
            </p>
